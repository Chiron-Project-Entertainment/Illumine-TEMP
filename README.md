# Illumine
  A first person parkour game heavily inspired by the original Mirror's Edge, which takes place in a post-apocalyptic universe in which the only way to survive is to stick as much as you can in underground burrows and any other hard-to-reach places. You, the player, are a messanger who needs to carry correspondence from one base to another, to keep the flame of hope burning. The safest way to walk around the city is through the rooftops, but, luckily enough, you do know quite a lot of parkour techniques, so that shouldn't be a problem for you. Or is it? Not the walls are the issue for you, not by a long shot, but the Haunting Darkness, which is this out-of-this-world "shadow" that always watches your every move, and follows you to the far corners of the world...
